# Web-cache (Furniture store)

This project was developed for an online store with the support of a hierarchical DBMS produced by InterSystems, positioned by the manufacturer as a multi-model.

Most of the project was built on the built-in programming language Caché Object Script (COS). In addition to COS, Caché provides developers with APIs for using object and SQL access to the same data.

# Features

  - Add, remove, and move goods
  - Drag and drop object
  - Catalog
  - News blog

The development took quite a long time (2-4 weeks xd).  As [Rishat7c] writes on the [Vk.com][df1]
